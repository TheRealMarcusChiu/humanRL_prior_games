levelGen folder contains codes to generate maps of varying difficulty (5 levels of difficulty) - some of the games are very hard as they have 3 plaforms, 2 ladders, and 1 enemy in it so training takes more than 100M+ steps 

levelGen_2 - games with varying difficulty (4 levels of difficulty) - they are easy but the continual nature of the task makes learning harder (40M+ steps to learn)

generalizationMaps - games that are new and old to test generalization of the RL agents trained on levelGen_2 maps
